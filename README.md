# Awesome WM
## Description
Minimalist Awesome WM theme.

## Dependencies
 - `blueman-applet`. For Bluetooth.
 - `nm-applet`. For WiFi.

That's that. I have to consider how feasible is to make widgets for this functionalities from the ground up to avoid further dependencies.
I don't want to use the terminal to do something like choosing a bluetooth device.

## Minor changes to defaults

I inverted the functioning of Super + j and Super + k. Now it is a little more intuitive for NVim users.
