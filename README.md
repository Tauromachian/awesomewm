# Awesome WM
## Description
Minimalist [ Awesome WM 4.3 ](https://awesomewm.org/) theme.

![Theme](https://images.jose-garcia.net/awesomewm.png)

## Dependencies
 - Blueman. For Bluetooth.
 - Network Manager. For WiFi.

I have to consider how feasible is to make widgets for this functionalities from the ground up to avoid dependencies.
I don't want to use the terminal to do something like choosing a Bluetooth device.

### Fonts

The default font is Noto sans, both for the tags icons and text


## Minor changes to defaults

I inverted the functioning of Super + j and Super + k. Now it is a little more intuitive for NVim users.

`Alt` + `clickdrag` Allows you to move the windows
